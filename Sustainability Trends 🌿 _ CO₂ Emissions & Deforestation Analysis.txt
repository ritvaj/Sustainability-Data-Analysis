Introduction
Sustainability is a deeply personal subject to me. In today's world, narratives around climate change are often polarizing — with some urging people to avoid even plastic straws, and others dismissing the entire issue as a hoax. As someone who works with data, I’ve come to realize that data is our clearest window into the truth. If data can solve complex business problems, why not apply it to the sustainability crisis?
This project was born from that question. By leveraging publicly available World Bank datasets and as my journey into the Business analysis skills deepens, I aimed to cut through the noise and present a clear, evidence-backed view of sustainability trends — focusing on CO₂ emissions and deforestation.
Objective
To uncover global patterns and disparities in CO₂ emissions and forest loss between 2019 and 2021 by:
* Analyzing emissions and forest trends across countries.

* Comparing the environmental impact of income groups (high to low income nations) and population.

* Creating narrative-rich reports for informed awareness that can lead to better ways of tackling the idea of sustainability in our day-to-day lives.
This project aims to provide easily understandable, insight-rich visuals for both technical and non-technical audiences — encouraging meaningful conversations around climate data.


Tools and Skills Applied
   * Analytical Thinking – Evaluating the value of information shown on-screen.
  
   * GPT-4o - Brainstorming and evaluating ideas and feedback, support with coding errors. 

   * ETL Concepts: End-to-end data pipeline development from choosing and extracting data to loading the final transformed data ready for analysis.

   * Python (Pandas): CSV file cleaning and export script for one dataset.

   * Excel: Manual data profiling and cleaning for four additional datasets.

   * SQL (MySQL): Data modeling, joining, and schema creation.

   * Power BI: Data import, DAX measures and calculated columns, data modeling, visual storytelling.

   * Accessibility & UX Design: Creative designing of the report, clean formatting, alt text, high contrast visuals.

Process Overview
The journey began by defining the scope and narrative of the project: to tell a story of environmental inequality through reliable data. I chose to focus on countries as the unit of analysis, organizing them by population, income level, and development level.
Data was sourced from the World Bank across five themes:
      * Land Area 

      * Population

      * Net National Income per Capita

      * CO₂ Emissions

      * Forest Area (Deforestation)

ETL Pipeline in Action:
         * Extract: CSV data from World Bank

         * Transform: Cleaned and standardized data using Python(Pandas) & Excel

         * Load: Imported data into MySQL and built a structured database, then connected to the database using Power BI.

         * Model: Connected to Power BI, performed final transformations

         * Visualize: Created dual-page dashboard with focused storytelling

Data Preparation & Cleaning
Out of five datasets, one (Deforestation) was cleaned using Python. The remaining four were handled in Excel:
            * In Python: I wrote a script using pandas to load the CSV, drop null values, rename columns for clarity, and export a cleaned version.
  


Jupyter Notebook: Python script for cleaning deforestation csv file
            * In Excel: I profiled and cleaned data manually — removing empty rows, aligning column names, and deleting irrelevant columns.
Additionally, I merged 4 datasets (Deforestation, Population, Income per capita, & Country land area) into one master table: deforestation and merged 3 datasets (Co2_emissions, Income per capita, and population) into another master table: Co2_emissions.
This allowed me to connect the dimension tables with fact tables consistently.
Additional calculated columns were also created including matching up the average income per capita of each country into their respective economic classes.
Data profiling was conducted before upload to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Data Modeling & Transformation
I created a MySQL database to store and manage the cleaned files. Tables included:
            * Co2_emissions (merged Co2_emissions, Population & Income per capita)

            * Deforestation (merged Deforestation, Population, Income per capita, & Country land area)
  
                MySQL: Schema and Tables creation using SQL


SQL Joins
Two key joins were written to connect the tables:


  
MySQL: Inner Join co2_emissions with population & income and creating calculated columns
  
MySQL: Inner Join deforestation with population, area & income and creating calculated columns
In Power BI
               * Connected to MySQL server.

               * Used Power Query for final tweaks and data profiling (removing anomaly values).

               * Created a Year table to enable consistent time filtering.
  


Data Model: Star Schema with shared Dim_year linked to both fact tables.
DAX Calculations
                  * In CO₂ Emissions: Created continent column, and measures like CO2 per Capita, Population % by Income Group.

                  * In Deforestation: Added continent, and Total Forested Area (2020) measures.

  
        DAX Measure: Population % by Income Group  
  
                 DAX Measure: Forest Area Loss (% of Forest Area)  
Insights Derived from the Data
Page 1: The Emission Gap — Income, Population, and Impact (2020)
                     * Top emitters by volume: China (11.9K Mt), USA, India

                     * Top emitters per capita: Qatar (37.8t), Bahrain, Trinidad

                     * Income group comparison:

                        * Upper-middle and high-income nations make only 44.53% of the total world population and yet contribute 82.2% of global CO₂!

                        * Lower and lower-middle income countries emit far less (17.8%) — but suffer disproportionately.

                           * Visual highlights:

                              * Card visuals for 2020 total emissions and average emissions by an individual in the year 2020. 

                              * Bar chart showing top CO₂ emitting countries.

                              * Bar chart showing top countries with the highest per capita CO₂ emission.

                              * Pie chart showing CO₂ emission distribution by income group.

                              * Donut chart showing percentage of population in each income group.


Page 2: Forest Decline — A Global View (2020)
                                 * Hotspots of forest loss: Brazil, China, Indonesia, Congo. Countries rapidly developing are deforesting to build infrastructure or using their forests as a resource.

                                 * Forest loss % of existing forest: Serbia, Côte d'Ivoire, Nicaragua. Serbia lost 3.8% of its total forest area in just a year.

                                 * Global tree cover snapshot:

                                    * 2/3 of countries have less than 40% forest cover.

                                    * True "Green Nations" are becoming a minority because the central tendency is shifting (reducing) towards 30% of forest cover out of the respective country's total land.

                                       * These insights reflect an urgent imbalance in environmental responsibility vs vulnerability.

Page 3: Forest Cover Forecast (2025 & Beyond)
To highlight the future impact of current trends, added a forecast based on historical forest cover data. The forecast shows a continued decline in forest cover percentage in tropical nations unless major reforestation efforts are made.
Key Insights:
                                             * Projected decline in forest cover for countries like Brazil, Indonesia, Congo, Myanmar, and Paraguay, based on trends from 1990–2020.

                                             * Positive gains in countries like Vietnam, Chile, Australia, and Türkiye, where sustained reforestation policies have reversed deforestation.

                                             * Visualized using Power BI’s forecast analytics, with a 95% confidence interval and historical trendline.

🧭This projection turns data into action—highlighting where we’re headed unless global sustainability commitments are scaled up.

Visual Design & Accessibility Features
I focused on making the report easy to digest for any reader. Here are the key elements employed:
                                                * Two themed pages with clear headers and sub-sections.

                                                * Simple, non-cluttered visuals with intuitive labeling and big font data labels for readability.

                                                * Accessibility features:

                                                   * Alt text for every chart

                                                   * Consistent high-contrast color palette

                                                   * Readable fonts

                                                   * Donut and bar charts with categorical legends

                                                   * Patterned shading for visual aid (where applicable)

                                                      * Positioning, sizing, and white space were all optimized for comprehension and visual balance.
Reflection
This project has been one of the most meaningful I’ve worked on. It allowed me to:
                                                      * Combine all my core data skills across SQL, Power BI, Python, and Excel and practice them hands-on. Although this was hard, but in the end this has given me immense confidence for my future analyses. 

                                                      * Use data storytelling to break down sustainability myths. This was enlightening in the sense that there should be more talks about environmental justice, and greenwashing instead of misdirecting to the usual “Small things that you can do to protect the environment”, while someone flies solo in their private jet burning tonnes of fuel and having an enormous Carbon Footprint!

                                                      * Deliver actionable insights through an elegant and professional report. I tried to deliver on the challenge of making the report easy to understand even for someone who has no relation to sustainability, or the analytics field. 

The Python step — although simple — was an exciting way to apply what I’d recently learned. More importantly, the project helped me experience how impactful a clean narrative and good visuals can be in conveying a serious message.
